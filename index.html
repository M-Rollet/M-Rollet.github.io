            <h1 id="section1">Introduction</h1>
            <h2>What are these secrets about?</h2>
            <p>
                During the Cold War, both the Western and Eastern blocs relied on soft power to spread ideological messages and influence global opinion, with cinema emerging as a key medium for this influence. This story explores how cinema served as a subtle but potent tool for political messaging during this period. In particular, how cinema can not only entertain but also embed ideologies, shape public views, and reflect the values and power dynamics of its time. To unveil these secrets, three main angles were explored:
                <ul>
                    <li>How international power dynamics and influence are reflected in film production.</li>
                    <li>How the themes and narratives of films were crafted to convey and promote specific ideologies.</li>
                    <li>How film characters were used, either as tools to manipulate populations or as mirrors of society.</li>
                </ul> 
            </p>

            <h2>Let's get our hands dirty!</h1>
            <p>The first step was to build a suitable dataset for this ambitious project.
                It's important to note that the original dataset was quite "America-centric,"
                which was a bit problematic for our study. To address this, we extended it with other datasets
                (source link) to achieve a more balanced representation, with more movies coming from other countries
                like Russia or Soviet Union. </p>
            
            <h2>A first glance at the data</h2>
            <p>After data augmentation and pre-processing, we ended up with a dataset containing 25621 films
                released between 1945 and 1995, of which 2919 are classified as Eastern side and 3142 as Western side.
                The map below ‚Äì which you can explore ‚Äì shows the number of movies released by countries.</p>
            
            <p class="text-center mb-1">Number of Films per country</p>
            <div id="map2" class="map-container"></div>

            <p>The United States and Russia stand out as the main film producers during this period,
                with 8239 and 10853 films respectively. This clearly illustrates their global dominance and Soft Power.
                There are also a large number of films from European countries such as France, United Kingdom, Italy and Germany.
                These countries play a relevant role in our study and could prove essential in the analysis of
                international collaboration in the film industry.

            <p>We also examined the distribution of films over year throughout the Cold War to identify
                trends that could provide insights for our analysis.

            <p>Throughout the Cold War, the number of films produced rose steadily.
                This suggests that cinema played an increasingly important role in the ideological conflict.

            <p>
                From the beginning of the Cold War, the Western Bloc (United States and its allies) quickly seemed
                to take the lead in film production, or at least, the number of films classified as Western dominated.
                This was likely aimed at asserting its cultural and ideological power in response to rising tensions.
                The production of western oriented films can be seen as a strategy to promote capitalist and democratic
                ideals, not only to its own audience but also to influence allies ‚Äì ensuring they did not switch sides ‚Äì
                and neutral countries.

            <p>
                Between 1952 and 1959, the number of films representing Eastern values increased significantly,
                even surpassing those representing the West. This sudden rise seems to be a reaction from the
                USSR and its partisans, seeking to promote their communist ideals and counter the Western cultural influence.
                The number of Eastern-oriented films surpassed that of Western-oriented films until 1984.
                Subsequently, fluctuations were observed, followed by a sharp decline in 1989.
                This decline also affected Western films and coincided with the fall of the Berlin Wall.
                As tensions eased, films no longer needed to embody bloc-specific values as much as they did during the conflit.

            <h2>The reflection of international dynamics and influences in film production</h2>
            <p>
                Clearly, the USA and the USSR are superpowers, demonstrating their superiority on all levels, including film production, as we've just seen. Yet beyond their status, these two nations seek to ‚Äúdominate‚Äù the world and rally as many countries as possible to their ideology. To achieve this goal, they cannot act alone. They must form alliances to contain the expansion of their adversaries and warn off potential aggression.

            <p>
                Do these alliances manifest themselves in film production? To find out, we've examined the films produced by each country and classified them according to the number of East- or West-oriented films. Here's how it looks (feel free to zoom in or move around the map).
            </p>

            <h6 class="text-center mt-4">Ratio of East- vs. West-Oriented Films</h6>
            <div id="map1" class="map-container"></div>

            <p>
                The map clearly shows the alliances formed during the Cold War, as we can mainly identify member countries of
                <ul>
                    <li>The Warsaw Pact</li>
                    <li>NATO</li>
                </ul>
                https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerre_froide
            </p>

            <p>
                If you take a closer look at European production, you can see the line of the Iron Wall. To the east of Germany, there is clearly a greater proportion of East-sided films. As the number of sided films per country is not necessarily huge, small differences between the number of west and east-sided films can quickly sway a country. Nevertheless, the result seems consistent with historical reality.

                As mentioned above, the map once again shows the superiority of American and Russian productions in terms of numbers. As our dataset does not have much information for African and South American countries, we clearly see a lack of analysis possibilities in these regions on the map.
            </p>

            <p>
                We do, however, have one clear initial result: film production was an important geopolitical propaganda tool during the Cold War. De facto, war imagery is a powerful tool for influencing the masses.

            <h2>
                Collaborations within the movie industry during the Cold War
            </h2>

            <p>
                This graph visualization of Cold War era film collaborations offers an insight into the political dynamics of the time.
                Keep in mind that, in this representation, the former countries of the USSR are considered individually, allowing for a nuanced understanding of their international relations. 
            </p>

            <!-- Plot: Collaboration network-->
            <iframe src="" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

            <p>
                A key observation is the tendency to form numerous co-productions between the United States and the Western European countries. This surge in collaborations could be seen as a strategic effort from the US to strengthen political and cultural ties with allies, using film as a tool for soft power during the Cold War.
            </p>

            <p>
                In stark contrast, the USSR appears to have limited co-production in the film industry. This lack of collaboration may be attributed to the desire of Soviet authorities to retain full control over the narratives, allowing them to use cinema as a vehicle for their propaganda. This theory is further supported by the highly centralized nature of the Soviet film industry, where the government tightly regulated production, unlike in the more decentralized Western bloc. Additionally, it is worth considering the cultural context. The theatre attendance in the USSR during this period was significantly higher than in the US, suggesting that the domestic market was flourishing enough to reduce the urgency for international collaborations.

                Interestingly, despite occasional connections with Western nations, the countries situated in the center and north of Europe preserved their neutral positioning, navigating the global tension with cautious diplomacy.

                Japan and Hong Kong present unique cases in the graph. Japan, while often neutral in its Cold War alignment, shows a notable collaboration with the US, revealing an underlying rapprochement despite the country's apparent neutrality. On the other hand, Hong Kong, though geographically in communist China, remains neutral in the context of the Cold War. That‚Äôs because of the city‚Äôs historical ties to the UK, making it a unique strategic position at the crossroads of East and Western ideologies.
            </p>

            <h2>How about the languages the films are translated into?</h2>

            <p>
                Turning to the analysis of language distribution in films during the Cold War, we observe that English is by far the most commonly used language. This finding strongly reinforces our observations of the spread of US soft power, shaping global cultural trends and making English the dominant language in international cinema. This could be seen as part of a bigger geopolitical strategy, with American cultural influence reaching far beyond its borders. However, it is important to mitigate this observation, as the United Kingdom was for the most part English-speaking. Therefore, the prominence of English is also a reflection of its established role in global film production.
            </p>

            <!-- Plot: Top 25 languages in movies-->
            <iframe src="" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

            <p>
                When we delve deeper into the language distribution for each bloc, the trend of English dominance remains consistent, even within films produced by Eastern bloc countries. This is a striking observation, as it highlights the reach of US cultural influence, which managed to penetrate even the closed-off environments of Eastern bloc cinema. The widespread use of English in the Eastern bloc suggests that the USA made important efforts to spread its cultural ideals, creating an undeniable link between language and political influence.

            <p>
                Interestingly, this phenomenon also hints at the reverse: Eastern bloc countries may have seen the benefit of using English to promote their ideas and narratives to Western audiences. In the context of the Cold War, where ideological battles were especially fought through cultural influence, the use of English in Eastern bloc films could be viewed as an attempt to make their voices heard within the global conversation.

            <h1>Thematic and Narrative Strategies in Movies to Promote Specific Ideologies</h1>

            <p>
                Now that we know that countries produce films oriented towards either side, and that they collaborate within these blocs to disseminate their ideas more widely, the question arises of what it means for a film to be classified as Eastern or Western. What are the characteristics of each classification, and more importantly, how do films convey the ideologies and values they aim to promote through the themes they address ‚Äî namely, capitalism in the West and communism in the East?
            </p>

            <p>
                Before proceeding with the analysis, we want to define some key periods of the Cold War that we will frequently refer to in the subsequent sections. These periods, identified from two websites, will help us explore the evolution of genres, themes, and even characters (covered in the last part):
                <ul>
                    <li>1947 - 1953: Blocs Establishment</li>
                    <li>1954 - 1962: Major tensions and crises</li>
                    <li>1963 - 1974: D√©tente</li>
                    <li>1975 - 1984: Second Cold War</li>
                    <li>1985 - 1991: End of the Cold War</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>A quick look at film genres</h2>
            <p>
                The genre of a movie is one of the first classifications that one can look at to understand the sort of movie one is about to watch. It is therefore interesting to look at how the distribution of genres differ across both sides, and how they evolved over time.
            </p>

            <!-- Plot: Distrib of genres ofr each side-->
            <iframe src="" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

            <p>
                On a first look, we can see that the most common genres appear to approximately similar frequencies in the western side as in the eastern side. To better understand the differences, we can instead look at the relative difference in appearances for each genre.
            </p>

            <!-- Plot: Prop relative genres for sides-->
            <iframe src="" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

            <p>
                It is particularly interesting that documentaries and history movies seem to appear much more frequently (in terms of proportion) in the eastern side than in the western side. On the other hand, Crime movies, Thrillers, Actions and the like are much more common in the western side than on the side of their ideological opponents. This suggests perhaps that the western side values showcasing their ideals implicitly through entertainment, while historical and documentary movies are preferred by the eastern side.

                A meaningful example is the film by Andrei Tarkovsky  called ‚ÄúIvan‚Äôs Childhood‚Äù in which the director ‚Äúportrays his hatred of war‚Äù through the childhood which ‚Äúcontrasts most with war‚Äù and looks at the human cost without glorifying the experience(Src: Andrei Tarkovsky Interviews by John Gianvito)

            <!-- Plot: War movie count over periods-->

            <p>
                The number of war movies during the cold war peaks between the major tensions and crises period and detente period. The evolution roughly matches the height of tensions, although the eastern war movies seem to persist longer than their western counterparts. This could be explained in a variety of ways, possibly by the new found ‚Äúrelative freedom‚Äù during the Khrushchev Thaw following a reduction in censorship after the death of Stalin who put film-makers under constant scrutiny and often required revisions to align with the state ideology.
            </p>

            <p>
                A quick analysis on the similarities and differences on the presence of different movie genres across the ideological spectrum reveals interesting trends throughout the cold war that reflect the realities of this ideological conflict. Although it does not tell us the whole story. We will do further analysis on war movies as a case study.
            </p>

            <h2>Deeper Analysis of War Films Through Exploration of Themes</h2>

            <p>
                But overall, war movies seem to be equally prevalent in the socialist bloc as they are in the anti-socialist bloc. This doesn‚Äôt mean however that war is portrayed in similar fashion. For this analysis, we can make use of movie themes.
            </p>

            <!-- Plot: Distrib of theme for each side-->
            <iframe src="" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

            <p>
                Similar to the genres‚Äô case, the most common themes appear to similar extents in both blocs. Doing Relative difference analysis on themes that appear at least 10 times yields much more interesting results.

            <p>
                It appears that terms like Struggle, Oppression, Occupation appear much more frequently in the eastern side, while, somewhat paradoxically, Comedy and Adventure are their counterparts in the western side. This could be due to Satirical movies, that hide their anti war messaging through over-exaggerated patriotism and a comedic portrayal of tragic events, ‚ÄúStarship Troopers‚Äù as an example, while soviet movies are generally less subtle in their messaging, as in ‚ÄúCome and See‚Äù, often described as one of the most tragically disturbing war-movies ever.

                Another noteworthy observation in this graph is the profound impact of the Vietnam War on Western cinema, particularly true in American society. The war has been revisited on the big screen numerous times since its conclusion, inspiring some of the most celebrated works in film history. One of the most iconic examples is Apocalypse Now, which portrays the war as a collective psychosis, a descent into madness. Rather than focusing on realism or historical accuracy, the film delves into impressionistic psychology to convey the chaos and trauma of the conflict.
            </p>

            <p>
                For more in-depth analysis of the themes present in the movies displayed in cinemas for western and eastern audiences, we will attempt to group into categories based on the overall tone and topic.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Evolution of Film Themes Across Cold War
            </h2>

            <p>
                Throughout the Cold War, shifting geopolitical tensions were often mirrored on the silver screen, with filmmakers using cinematic narratives to both reflect and shape public sentiment. By clustering movie themes into four distinct categories we can observe how cultural and political climates influenced the tone and content of films produced in Eastern versus Western blocs during key Cold War intervals.

            <iframe src="" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

            <h3 class="h5">Cluster 1 : War & Spy Dramas</h3>
                <p>
                    These movies often focus on struggles between nations, secret missions, and the sacrifices made by soldiers, spies, and everyday people caught in the crossfire. Tension, loyalty, and bravery shape their stories, while betrayal and survival underline how dangerous and uncertain their worlds can be. Audiences can expect tense action, moral challenges, and an atmosphere of global conflict.
                </p>

            <h3 class="h5">Cluster 2 : Crime & Moral Thrillers</h3>
                <p>
                    In these films, characters often wrestle with questions of right and wrong, facing corruption, betrayal, and injustice at every turn. Set against a backdrop of criminal acts and moral conflicts, they test the strength of convictions and the power of redemption. Audiences can expect suspenseful stories that reflect the darker side of human nature and the struggle for integrity in a flawed world.
                </p>

            <h3 class="h5">Cluster 3 : Romance & Social Drama</h3>
                <p>
                    These stories center on human relationships, personal growth, and the bonds of family and community. Love often stands alongside struggle, identity, and cultural differences. Viewers will find heartfelt narratives where life‚Äôs challenges and sacrifices bring people closer together or drive them apart, reflecting the richness and complexity of everyday life.
                </p>

            <h3 class="h5">Cluster 4 : Political Dramas</h3>
                <p>
                    These films dive into the world of politics, revolutions, and the forces that shape history. They blend mystery, satire, and sometimes humor to explore how power is gained, maintained, and challenged. Expect stories that mix serious reflection with clever insight, revealing the hidden games, investigations, and shifting alliances at the heart of political life.
                </p>

            <p>
                Let‚Äôs now represent for each major period of the Cold War the repartition of these themes in the industry.

                During the Cold War, both Eastern and Western films showed some shared patterns alongside clear differences in their storytelling choices. For example, around the d√©tente period (1963-1974), both sides featured a noticeable peak in romance and social dramas. At the same time, crime and moral thrillers dipped, hinting that periods of relative calm and openness might have encouraged stories centered more on personal feelings and social life than on lawlessness or moral crises.

                Despite these moments of overlap, the film cultures of the Eastern and Western blocs often diverged. Eastern cinema consistently placed a much heavier emphasis on crime and moral thrillers, suggesting an enduring focus on justice, oppression, and moral struggle. Over time, Eastern films also steadily increased their share of war and spy dramas, reflecting a rising interest in issues of conflict, secrecy, and loyalty, especially toward the later years of the Cold War.

                Western productions, on the other hand, balanced their themes in a different way, maintaining more consistent levels of each genre. The differences appear more rooted in cultural perspectives and narrative traditions than in the shifting geopolitical climate. While time periods did influence certain trends‚Äîlike the d√©tente-related surge in romance and social stories‚Äîunderlying cultural approaches to morality, heroism, and personal life shaped the steady contrast in what each side‚Äôs filmmakers chose to highlight. In other words, the data doesn‚Äôt just show us when themes changed; it helps us understand how deeply woven these storytelling choices were into the fabric of each bloc‚Äôs cultural identity.
