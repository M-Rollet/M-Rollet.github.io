            <h1 id="section1">Introduction</h1>
            <h2>What are these secrets about?</h2>
            <p>
                During the Cold War, both the Western and Eastern blocs turned to cinema as a subtle yet powerful tool to influence global opinion and spread ideological messages. Films weren’t just about entertainment—they carried deeper meanings, embedding values, shaping public views, and reflecting the power dynamics of the time. In this story, we explore how cinema played its part in the Cold War through three lenses: the power dynamics behind film production, the ideological messages woven into themes and narratives, and the ways characters reflected or influenced society.

            <h2>Let's get our hands dirty!</h1>
            <p>
                The first step is to build a suitable dataset for this ambitious project. It's important to note that the original dataset<sup><a href="#source1">[1]</a></sup> is quite "America-centric", which is a bit problematic for our study. To address this, we extend it with other datasets<sup><a href="#source2">[2,</a><a href="#source3">3]</a></sup> to achieve a more balanced representation, with more movies coming from other countries like Russia or Soviet Union. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Working with this collection of movie plot summaries, we want to find out if each movie is connected to the Cold War. If it is, we aim to identify which side it supports, the character that best represents each side’s values (e.g. protagonist vs. antagonist), and to extract keywords about the movie's themes for added context.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to recent advances in NLP and large language models, we can use prompt engineering and GPT-4o mini for this task. For each movie, we input its release year, title, and plot summary. In return, we get new information about which side it might support, the themes it covers, the values tied to each bloc, and the characters who represent those values.
            </p>
            <p>
                In total, we identify 6,061 movies that are associated with one of the blocs. They represent around 25% of our dataset with a good balance between the Western and Eastern blocs, which is a non-negligible proportion of our dataset.
            </p>

Even though this tool was used with good intentions and that efforts were made to minimize "hallucinations," its responses aren’t 100% accurate. It’s important to keep this limitation in mind throughout the study. Also, don’t forget that OpenAI GPT tends to reflect a Western cultural bias. This may influence its interpretations and could underrepresented perspectives from other parts of the world.

            <p>
                After data augmentation and pre-processing, we end up with a dataset containing 25,621 films released between 1945 and 1995, of which 2,919 are classified as Eastern side and 3,142 as Western side. The map below—which you can explore—shows the number of movies released by countries.

            <div id="map2" class="map-container"></div>

            <p>The United States and Russia stand out as the main film producers during this period,
                with 8,239 and 10,853 films respectively. This clearly illustrates their global dominance and Soft Power.
                There are also a large number of films from European countries such as France, United Kingdom, Italy and Germany.
                These countries play a relevant role in our study and could prove essential in the analysis of
                international collaboration in the film industry.

            <p>We also examine the distribution of films over year throughout the Cold War to identify
                trends that could provide insights for our analysis.

            <p>Throughout the Cold War, the number of films produced rose steadily.
                This suggests that cinema played an increasingly important role in the ideological conflict.

                                And considering how the number of films dropped after 1991, it’s clear that cinema was used for other purposes than just entertainment during the Cold War <span style="font-style: normal;">🧐</span>.

                These are the results for all the films in our dataset. If we focus exclusively on the films with a clear alignment toward one of the Cold War blocs, we observe the following distribution.

            <p>
                From the beginning of the Cold War, the Western Bloc (United States and its allies) quickly seemed
                to take the lead in film production, or at least, the number of films classified as Western dominated.
                This was likely aimed at asserting its cultural and ideological power in response to rising tensions.
                The production of Western oriented films can be seen as a strategy to promote capitalist and democratic
                ideals, not only to its own audience but also to influence allies – ensuring they did not switch sides –
                and neutral countries.

            <p>
                Between 1952 and 1959, the number of films representing Eastern values increased significantly,
                even surpassing those representing the West. This sudden rise seems to be a reaction from the
                USSR and its partisans, seeking to promote their communist ideals and counter the Western cultural influence.
                The number of Eastern-oriented films surpassed that of Western-oriented films until 1984.
                Subsequently, fluctuations were observed, followed by a sharp decline in 1989.
                This decline also affected Western films and coincided with the fall of the Berlin Wall.
                As tensions eased, films no longer needed to embody bloc-specific values as much as they did during the conflit.

            <p>
                Clearly, the USA and the USSR are superpowers, demonstrating their superiority on all levels, including film production, as we've just seen. Yet beyond their status, these two nations seek to "dominate" the world and rally as many countries as possible to their ideology. To achieve this goal, they cannot act alone. They must form alliances to contain the expansion of their adversaries and warn off potential aggression.

            <p>
                Do these alliances manifest themselves in film production? To find out, we've examined the films produced by each country and classified them according to the number of East- or West-oriented films. Here's how it looks (feel free to zoom in or move around the map).
            </p>

            <h6 class="text-center mt-4">Ratio of East- vs. West-Oriented Films</h6>
            <div id="map1" class="map-container"></div>

            <p>
                The map clearly shows the alliances<a href="#source5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> formed during the Cold War, as we can mainly identify member countries of
                <ul>
                    <li>The Warsaw Pact</li>
                    <li>NATO</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                If you take a closer look at European production, you can see the line of the Iron Wall. To the east of Germany, there is clearly a greater proportion of East-sided films. As the number of sided films per country is not necessarily huge, small differences between the number of west and east-sided films can quickly sway a country. Nevertheless, the result seems consistent with historical reality.
            </p>

            <p>
                As mentioned above, the map once again shows the superiority of American and Russian productions in terms of numbers. As our dataset does not have much information for African and South American countries, we clearly see a lack of analysis possibilities in these regions on the map.
                We do, however, have one clear initial result: film production was an important geopolitical propaganda tool during the Cold War. De facto, war imagery is a powerful tool for influencing the masses.

                                Hmm, that’s an interesting first look at alliances through cinema.

            <h2>
                Collaborations within the movie industry during the Cold War
            </h2>

            <p>
                This graph visualization of Cold War era film collaborations offers an insight into the political dynamics of the time.
                Keep in mind that, in this representation, the former countries of the USSR are considered individually, allowing for a nuanced understanding of their international relations. 
            </p>

            <!-- Plot: Collaboration network-->
            <iframe src="graphs/static_graph.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

            <p>
                A key observation is the tendency to form numerous co-productions between the United States and the Western European countries. This surge in collaborations could be seen as a strategic effort from the US to strengthen political and cultural ties with allies, using film as a tool for soft power during the Cold War.
            </p>

            <p>
                In stark contrast, the USSR appears to have limited co-production in the film industry. This lack of collaboration may be attributed to the desire of Soviet authorities to retain full control over the narratives, allowing them to use cinema as a vehicle for their propaganda. This theory is further supported by the highly centralized nature of the Soviet film industry, where the government tightly regulated production, unlike in the more decentralized Western bloc. Additionally, it is worth considering the cultural context. The theatre attendance in the USSR during this period was significantly higher than in the US<a href="source6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, suggesting that the domestic market was flourishing enough to reduce the urgency for international collaborations.

                Interestingly, despite occasional connections with Western nations, the countries situated in the center and north of Europe preserved their neutral positioning, navigating the global tension with cautious diplomacy.

                Japan and Hong Kong present unique cases in the graph. Japan, while often neutral in its Cold War alignment, shows a notable collaboration with the US, revealing an underlying rapprochement despite the country's apparent neutrality. On the other hand, Hong Kong, though geographically in communist China, remains neutral in the context of the Cold War. That’s because of the city’s historical ties to the UK, making it a unique strategic position at the crossroads of East and Western ideologies.

            <h2>How about the languages the films are translated into?</h2>

            <p>
                Turning to the analysis of language distribution in films during the Cold War, we observe that English is by far the most commonly used language. This finding strongly reinforces our observations of the spread of US soft power, shaping global cultural trends and making English the dominant language in international cinema. This could be seen as part of a bigger geopolitical strategy, with American cultural influence reaching far beyond its borders. However, it is important to mitigate this observation, as the United Kingdom was for the most part English-speaking. Therefore, the prominence of English is also a reflection of its established role in global film production.
            </p>

            <!-- Plot: Top 25 languages in movies-->
            <iframe src="graphs/top_languages.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

            <p>
                When we delve deeper into the language distribution for each bloc, the trend of English dominance remains consistent, even within films produced by Eastern bloc countries. This is a striking observation, as it highlights the reach of US cultural influence, which managed to penetrate even the closed-off environments of Eastern bloc cinema. The widespread use of English in the Eastern bloc suggests that the USA made important efforts to spread its cultural ideals, creating an undeniable link between language and political influence.

            <p>
                Interestingly, this phenomenon also hints at the reverse: Eastern bloc countries may have seen the benefit of using English to promote their ideas and narratives to Western audiences. In the context of the Cold War, where ideological battles were especially fought through cultural influence, the use of English in Eastern bloc films could be viewed as an attempt to make their voices heard within the global conversation.

            <h1 id="section4">Thematic and Narrative in Movies to Promote Ideologies</h1>

            <p>
                Now that we know that countries produce films oriented towards either side, and that they collaborate within these blocs to disseminate their ideas more widely, the question arises of what it means for a film to be classified as Eastern or Western. What are the characteristics of each classification, and more importantly, how do films convey the ideologies and values they aim to promote through the themes they address—namely, capitalism in the West and communism in the East?
            </p>

            <p>
                Before proceeding with the analysis, we want to define some key periods of the Cold War that we will frequently refer to in the subsequent sections. These periods, identified from two websites<sup><a href="source7">[7,</a><a href="source8">8]</a></sup>, will help us explore the evolution of genres, themes, and even characters (covered in the last part):
                <ul>
                    <li>1947 - 1953: Blocs Establishment</li>
                    <li>1954 - 1962: Major tensions and crises</li>
                    <li>1963 - 1974: Détente</li>
                    <li>1975 - 1984: Second Cold War</li>
                    <li>1985 - 1991: End of the Cold War</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>A quick look at film genres</h2>
            <p>
                The genre of a movie is one of the first classifications that one can look at to understand the sort of movie one is about to watch. It is therefore interesting to look at how the distribution of genres differ across both sides, and how they evolved over time.
            </p>

            <!-- Plot: Distrib of genres for each side-->
            <iframe src="" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

            <p>
                On a first look, we can see that the most common genres appear to approximately similar frequencies in the Western side as in the Eestern side. To better understand the differences, we can instead look at the relative difference in appearances for each genre.

            <!-- Plot: Prop relative genres for sides-->
            <iframe src="" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

            <p>
                It is particularly interesting that documentaries and history movies seem to appear much more frequently (in terms of proportion) in the Eestern side than in the Western side. On the other hand, Crime movies, Thrillers, Actions and the like are much more common in the Western side than on the side of their ideological opponents. This suggests perhaps that the Western side values showcasing their ideals implicitly through entertainment, while historical and documentary movies are preferred by the Eestern side.

So, it’s no surprise that Soviet cinema features more documentaries and fewer action-packed blockbusters.

                A meaningful example is the film by Andrei Tarkovsky  called "Ivan’s Childhood" in which the director "portrays his hatred of war" through the childhood which "contrasts most with war" and looks at the human cost without glorifying the experience<a href="#source10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>.

            <p>
                The number of war movies during the cold war peaks between the major tensions and crises period and detente period. The evolution roughly matches the height of tensions, although the Eestern war movies seem to persist longer than their Western counterparts. This could be explained in a variety of ways, possibly by the new found "relative freedom" during the Khrushchev Thaw following a reduction in censorship after the death of Stalin who put film-makers under constant scrutiny and often required revisions to align with the state ideology.
            </p>

            <p>
                A quick analysis on the similarities and differences on the presence of different movie genres across the ideological spectrum reveals interesting trends throughout the cold war that reflect the realities of this ideological conflict. Although it does not tell us the whole story. We will do further analysis on war movies as a case study.
            </p>

            <h2>Deeper Analysis of War Films Through Exploration of Themes</h2>

            <p>
                But overall, war movies seem to be equally prevalent in the socialist bloc as they are in the anti-socialist bloc. This doesn’t mean however that war is portrayed in similar fashion. For this analysis, we can make use of movie themes.

            <!-- Plot: Distrib of theme for each side-->

            <p>
                Similar to the genres’ case, the most common themes appear to similar extents in both blocs. Doing Relative difference analysis on themes that appear at least 10 times yields much more interesting results.

            <p>
                It appears that terms like Struggle, Oppression, Occupation appear much more frequently in the Eestern side, while, somewhat paradoxically, Comedy and Adventure are their counterparts in the Western side. This could be due to Satirical movies, that hide their anti war messaging through over-exaggerated patriotism and a comedic portrayal of tragic events, "Starship Troopers" as an example, while soviet movies are generally less subtle in their messaging, as in "Come and See", often described as one of the most tragically disturbing war-movies ever.

                                Even when both blocs tackled the same topic, their approaches were totally different.

The Soviet Union, on the other hand, took a much more direct and straightforward approach… Not sure if it convinced people, but it definitely helped instill fear and maintaining control.

            <p>
                Another noteworthy observation in this graph is the profound impact of the Vietnam War on Western cinema, particularly true in American society. The war has been revisited on the big screen numerous times since its conclusion, inspiring some of the most celebrated works in film history. One of the most iconic examples is Apocalypse Now, which portrays the war as a collective psychosis, a descent into madness. Rather than focusing on realism or historical accuracy, the film delves into impressionistic psychology to convey the chaos and trauma of the conflict.
            </p>

            <p>
                For more in-depth analysis of the themes present in the movies displayed in cinemas for Western and Eestern audiences, we will attempt to group into categories based on the overall tone and topic.

            <h2>

            <p>
                Throughout the Cold War, shifting geopolitical tensions were often mirrored on the silver screen, with filmmakers using cinematic narratives to both reflect and shape public sentiment. By clustering movie themes into four distinct categories we can observe how cultural and political climates influenced the tone and content of films produced in Eastern versus Western blocs during key Cold War intervals.

                Let’s now represent for each major period of the Cold War the repartition of these themes in the industry.
            </p>

            <p>
                During the Cold War, both Eastern and Western films showed some shared patterns alongside clear differences in their storytelling choices. For example, around the détente period (1963-1974), both sides featured a noticeable peak in romance and social dramas. At the same time, crime and moral thrillers dipped, hinting that periods of relative calm and openness might have encouraged stories centered more on personal feelings and social life than on lawlessness or moral crises.
            </p>

            <p>
                Despite these moments of overlap, the film cultures of the Eastern and Western blocs often diverged. Eastern cinema consistently placed a much heavier emphasis on crime and moral thrillers, suggesting an enduring focus on justice, oppression, and moral struggle. Over time, Eastern films also steadily increased their share of war and spy dramas, reflecting a rising interest in issues of conflict, secrecy, and loyalty, especially toward the later years of the Cold War.
            </p>

            <p>
                Western productions, on the other hand, balanced their themes in a different way, maintaining more consistent levels of each genre. The differences appear more rooted in cultural perspectives and narrative traditions than in the shifting geopolitical climate. While time periods did influence certain trends—like the détente-related surge in romance and social stories—underlying cultural approaches to morality, heroism, and personal life shaped the steady contrast in what each side’s filmmakers chose to highlight. In other words, the data doesn’t just show us when themes changed; it helps us understand how deeply woven these storytelling choices were into the fabric of each bloc’s cultural identity.
            </p>

            <h1 id="section5">What about movie characters?</h1>

            <p>
                After exploring the themes and scenarios of films and discovering that, beyond reflecting the social and political climate of their time, they also serve as a subtle and valuable instrument of influence, it is pertinent to question the role of characters to delve deeper into the analysis of cinema during the Cold War.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the heart of every film, characters emerge as the true drivers of the story. We follow their journeys, share their emotions, and at times, feel affection, admiration, or even hatred toward them. Their ability to captivate and influence audiences is undeniable.

            <p>
                We focused on three key dimensions to better understand their role during the Cold War:
                <ul>
                    <li>Were they used to convey ideologies and shape public opinion?</li>
                    <li>Do they mirror the political conflicts and tensions of the era?</li>
                    <li>Do they represent the opinions and sentiments shared by populations of their time?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Our dataset contains no fewer than 7,052 characters or groups of characters classified as representing one of the two blocs. Among these, 3,726 figures represent the Eastern bloc, while 3,326 represent the West. 
            </p>

            <h2>Characters as Vectors of Ideologies</h2>

            <p>
                If characters are used as vehicles for ideas and ideologies, there must be recurring archetypes in cinematic narratives. We wondered if it was possible, through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analysis, to identify the major themes embodied by characters based on their affiliation with the Eastern or Western Bloc. After several trials of topic detection, it became clear that three archetypes per bloc were sufficient to analyze the different representations of values associated with each side in the films.

                The extraction of these themes reveals two interesting points:
                <ul>
                    <li>Characters clearly embody values that are distinct and characteristic of their bloc. Indeed, the values of community and sacrifice are much more prominent in Eastern characters, while in the West, individualism and the desire for freedom dominate.</li>
                    <li>The absence of the "villain" archetype among the characters representing the West in the extracted themes. In contrast, this archetype is clearly present in the themes associated with the characters of the East. This suggests that no film, regardless of its alignment, portrays the "villain" as a representative of the West… Was the Soviet Union more lenient in its representation of the opposition? This is what we will explore very soon!</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Character Archetypes</h2>

            <p>
                Before we proceed, here is an overview of the character archetypes that match the extracted topics. To define them, we relied on the distribution of words within the topics, also considering the overall term frequency to assess the relevance of each word. Indeed, a word that is very present in a topic but also widespread throughout the entire corpus (the descriptions of our characters) is less significant than a word that is very present in a topic and less frequent in the rest of the corpus.
            </p>

            <p>
                We can identify two distinct strategies employed by the two blocs. On one hand, the Western Bloc, while predominantly showcasing characters aligned with its own side (725 Western characters), does not overlook portraying adversaries (569 Eestern characters). In fact, it often depicts them negatively—269 authoritarian villains out of 569 characters, roughly one in two. Western representatives, however, are consistently portrayed as engaging archetypes, embodying Western values (as outlined in our archetypes cards). Even when complex figures like antiheroes are featured, they remain compelling and intriguing for the audience.
            </p>

            <p>
                On the other hand, the Soviet Union takes a different approach, focusing on its own representatives (850 Eestern characters), often portrayed as Tragic Heroes or Community Defenders who embody communist ideologies. While there are a few "negative" portrayals of Eastern characters, they are negligible (200 out of over 850). Moreover, Western characters are rarely featured in Soviet films (267 Western characters), and when they do appear,  they are not particularly negatively portrayed. Instead, Soviet cinema prioritizes showcasing "good Soviets" over vilifying "bad Americans."

                                Alright, it’s obvious the characters are political vectors, embodying the values and ideologies of each side. But surely, they’re not just that… right?

            <h2>Characters as Mirrors of Tensions and Public Opinion</h2>

            <p>
                Beyond embodying these archetypes—let's be honest—which are often idealistic and inaccessible, the characters could also serve to reflect a prevalent public opinion during a specific period, allowing the population to identify more easily with them. This is what we have explored through semantic analysis of the lexicon associated with each character. Here is the result (feel free to interact with the plot by activating or deactivating certain categories to better observe and compare their variations).

            <p>
                Viewed this way, it might seem a bit chaotic. HOWEVER, we can already observe some interesting trends. The lexicon of heroism almost always dominates the other categories. Almost? We'll come back to that ;). Additionally, we see a clear increase in the presence of lexicon related to politics and power throughout the Cold War, illustrating the significant presence of this theme in films from that era. So far, everything seems coherent, but let's delve deeper and observe this evolution for each major period of the Cold War.

                        <p>The rise in ideological tensions is reflected in the increased frequency of politics & power themes (from 0.25 to 0.35). The evolution of heroic themes (from 0.4 to 0.45) may reflect the construction of heroic figures tied to political ideals (for example, patriotic characters in Western films or exemplary workers in Soviet films). We also observe a clear increase in the representation of support & solidarity (from 0.14 to 0.21), which could be linked to calls for national unity and social cohesion in the context of world's bipolarisation.</p>

                        <p>The heroic and politics & power categories remain high and relatively stable, with no notable change in trend. However, a clear increase in deception is visible in 1955, perhaps linked to political summits and negotiations such as the 1955 Geneva Conference, which was an attempt at détente but yielded no concrete results, leading to widespread disappointment. Additionally, a peak is observed in 1962, which occurs after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and coincides with the start of the Cuban Missile Crisis, a pivotal moment in the Cold War that also marked the beginning of the Détente.</p>

                        <p>The beginning of this period shows a slight increase (in 1965) in the theme of love & affection, perhaps indicating a desire for more positive human relationships after the world narrowly avoided catastrophe. Although heroism is present, there is a downward trend between 1969 and 1973, which coincides with a significant increase in politics-related topics. One possible explanation is the presence of American troops in Vietnam and the unprecedented media coverage of this conflict. These were challenging years for the American executive, marked by numerous scandals and a decrease in support from the American population. The rise in deception and the decline in pride also illustrate these facts<a href="#source11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>.</p>

                        <p>Tensions resurface, heroism and politics remain constant, while solidarity, already scarce, decreases significantly. The term law appears slightly more frequently than in other periods, reflecting an effort to curb arms production and violence through treaties to prevent another crisis like the one in Cuba.</p>

                        <p>Starting in 1988, a notable decrease in politics & power is observed, reflecting the easing of tensions, particularly with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Their frequency drops to 0.27, after fluctuating around 0.35 throughout the conflict. In 1991, political themes are even surpassed by deception, which reaches its maximum frequency, while support & solidarity reach their lowest levels. This illustrates the profound impact of the conflict on populations and could indicate a loss of bearings at the end of these tumultuous years. The decline in support & solidarity also suggests a weakening of collective ideals, marking a transition towards more individualistic concerns.</p>

            <h1 id="section6">Let's sum up</h1>
            <p>
                The Cold War wasn’t just a political and military struggle; it unfolded through the world of cinema, where films became tools of ideological influence. Both the Western and Eastern blocs used movies to convey their values and shape public opinion. The USA and the USSR dominated global film production, with clear alliances reflected in the number of films produced by NATO countries and Warsaw Pact members. Western nations leaned into collaborations, reinforcing cultural ties, while the USSR focused on controlling narratives to maintain ideological purity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The stories crafted during this era reveal how deeply cinema was embedded in the ideological conflict. Western films often promoted capitalist ideals through genres like action, thrillers, and crime, while Eastern films favored documentaries and historical dramas to highlight themes of struggle, oppression, and community values. War films surged during periods of heightened tensions, with Western productions delivering their messages through entertainment and satire, while Eastern cinema took a more direct and somber approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                Characters played a crucial role as vectors of these ideologies. Western heroes often embodied individualism, freedom, and justice, while Eastern characters emphasized sacrifice, loyalty, and collective strength. Western films frequently depicted Eastern villains, reinforcing the ideological divide, whereas Soviet films prioritized showcasing their own heroes over vilifying the West.
            </p>
            <p>
                These trends shifted in line with the broader Cold War timeline. During periods of détente, there was a rise in romance and social dramas, reflecting a temporary easing of global tensions. When crises flared, war and spy dramas dominated, mirroring the conflict's intensity. As the Cold War ended, themes of deception and disillusionment emerged, capturing the uncertainty and changing sentiments of the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, the data reveals that cinema was a subtle yet powerful arena of ideological combat. Movies reflected the global power struggle, reinforced alliances, and influenced public opinion, proving that the silver screen was far more than a place for simple entertainment during the Cold War.
